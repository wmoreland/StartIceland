# StartIceland

This plugin quickly throws together a simple map of Iceland using WFS layers provided by [Landmælingar Íslands](https://www.lmi.is/), the national land survey of Iceland.

For now, just a polygon of the coastline and polygons of the glaciers are loaded.

Future work may include a settings menu to list local files to load or change which online files to include.
